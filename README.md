# Fontetoe

This is a version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe that implements the min-max algorithm. The player has to keep track of 9 tic tac toe boards at a time and each time a board is won, it is claimed by either the player or computer. The goal is to claim 3 boards in a row; meaning that the game is meta.
